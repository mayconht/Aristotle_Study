# Fundamentals of Testing

## What is Software Testing?
Software testing is a set of activities to discover defects and evaluate the quality of software work products. A common misconception is that testing is only about
executing tests to find defects. Testing also includes activities such as planning, designing, and reporting. Which aligns with the SDLC.

Another misconception is that testing can prove the absence of defects. Testing can only show the presence of defects, not their absence. Also, the testing does not 
entirely focus on validating the test object, but also whether the system meets the users' needs and requirements, validations and operational environment.

Tests may be dynamic or static. Dynamic testing involves executing the software, while static testing involves reviewing and analyzing the software without execution.
We are going to talk about this later. **Chapter 4**

More important than that, testing is not only a technical activity, but also needs to be properly planned, managed, estimated and controlled. **(chapter 5)**

### Test Objectives 
**K1**

The typical objectives of testing are to:
* Evaluating work products such as requirements, design, user stories, code, and documentation.
* Causing failures and finding defects.
* Ensuring requirement coverage of a test object.
* Reducing the risk level of inadequate software quality.
* Verifying whether specified requirements have been fulfilled.
* Verifying that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements.
* Providing information to stakeholders about the quality of the test object to allow them to make informed decisions.
* Building confidence in the test object and its quality.
* Validating that the test object meets the needs of the user and other stakeholders and it is complete.

Keep in mind they can vary, depending on the context of the project, the test object, and the stakeholders involved.

### Testing and debugging
* They are separate activities.
* Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors.
* Debugging is the process of finding, analyzing, and removing the causes of failures in software.
* Testing can show the presence of defects, but not their absence.
* Debugging can show the root cause of a defect and how to fix it.

## Why is Testing Necessary?
Testing is necessary to ensure the quality of software products and to identify defects that could lead to failures in production. It helps to:
* Ensure that the software meets the requirements and expectations of stakeholders.
* Identify defects early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later.
* Reduce the risk of software failures in production, which can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.
* Improve the overall quality of the software product, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* Provide confidence to stakeholders that the software is fit for purpose and meets their needs.

### Testing and Quality Assurance
While people often use the terms "testing" and "quality assurance" interchangeably, they are not the same thing. 
* Testing is product oriented focusing on activities related to the test object.
* Quality assurance is process oriented, focusing on the processes used to develop and maintain the software.
  * QA applies to both the test object and the processes used to develop and maintain it.
